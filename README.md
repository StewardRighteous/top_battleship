# BattleShip Game

Battleship (also known as Battleships) is a strategy type guessing game for two players. 

 The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
